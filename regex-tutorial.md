# Regex Tutorial

During this activity, I will be walking you through some of the Regex components that I was able to learn during my chapter 17 computer science section. 

## Summary

Below are the different components I will be covering. These are all different components of Regex. RegEx stands for Regular Expressions which are objects within the Javascript language. you can use these objects to match, replace, and split strings. 

## Table of Contents

- [Anchors](#anchors)
- [Quantifiers](#quantifiers)
- [Grouping Constructs](#grouping-constructs)
- [Bracket Expressions](#bracket-expressions)
- [Character Classes](#character-classes)
- [The OR Operator](#the-or-operator)
- [Flags](#flags)
- [Character Escapes](#character-escapes)

## Regex Components

### Anchors
- Anchors are a type of Regex tokens that dont match any specific characters. Anchors are used to determine a strings location, for instance at the beginning or the end. 

### Quantifiers
- Quantifiers are used to identify how many characters or expressions will match. There are multiple types of quantifiers. For instance there is greedy and non greedy. Greedy quantifiers will try and find as many matches as possible. Non greedy will stop when it finds the first match. 

### Grouping Constructs
- Grouping Constructs are used to find substrings with in a string input. You will be able to extract the substring from the string input.

### Bracket Expressions
- Bracket Expression is used to match a single character. You can also define how many times you will want to match a single character. 

### Character Classes
- Character classes are used to match only a single character and cannot be used to match mutliple characters. You can define what type of character that you are matching. 

### The OR Operator
- You can use the OR operator to increase the power of the regular expression. 

### 
- Flags are used to search for something specifically. You will also be able to specify the searches youa re looking for. 

### Character Escapes
-- Character Escapes are a more powerful search that would be used to search for one individual character.
